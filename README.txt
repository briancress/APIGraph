This project allows you to download data from two different APIs, save them to text files on your computer, and then finally visualize the data on graphs.
It is simple to follow, as there is a UI to guide you. You run the code from APIGraph.py and it imports the other modules to run the code.
You simply enter either football or movies depending on which data you wish to see, then you will be guided further to specify the data you
can download.
